## Link between Social Media Platform's Layoff and User Comment Toxicity

**(Still in sketch:)**

I was wondering for quite long that in my personal Instagram account, there have been a lot of toxic comments ranging from misogny, racism, homophobia and even on seemingly innocuous contents. It feels on such an unimaginable scale, but I could not find anything on my search engine about this topic except on Reddit a few times.

Recently, Bloomberg's [Social Media Companies Moderation Efforts Lost Steam in 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-26/social-media-companies-moderation-efforts-lost-steam-in-2023) connects a series of layoffs in Big Tech that reduce quality policies and content moderation in favor of cost-saving. Which prompts me to check if there is some time alignment between layoffs and the prevalence of toxic comments.

Twitter might be in some way easier to check due to its public data (albeit it's getting harder due to API restriction). But Meta has been guarding their user data for a long time, sometimes too long (fortunately European Union recent policy might break this).

So I searched via Google Search by selecting custom range of date and `site:reddit.com`. Incognito mode, no account login.

### 1. Before May 2023, there does not seem to be any Reddit thread discussing about comment toxicity.

At least not ones rising to the top of Google's result.

### 2. There is a somewhat-related prominent thread in May 2023.

[The thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/13ramoj/is_there_a_way_to_just_disable_comments_on_all_of/) discussed about a Reddit poster's partner who got frustrated with Instagram reels' comments and that they were finding an option to disable comments.

### 3. There are some threads arising in June 2023.

Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/14doul3/instagram_reel_comments_are_overwhelmingly/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/14ee0r7/anyone_think_the_toxicity_of_instagram_comments/) and also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/14m0pm4/controversial_comments_first/).

### 4. And the rests follows. Like, as usual, what Reddit usually does toward other social media platforms.

A manual search on top posts on Reddit related to `Instagram` and `comment` gives me a post with 20K like as of January 2023, depicting severely dangerous environment in Instagram: [Content warning: suicide, homophobia](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/184p18c/a_16_year_old_committed_suicide_due_to_hate_he/).

### 5. Coincidentally, Meta has been laying down a lot of employees in three series of wave: November 2022, April 2023 and May 2023. Most of the employees laid off are from non-engineering departments.

I was really surprised at how much the timeframe just align in May 2023, since I thought they would have some few months of gaps or overlaps.


### 6. In addition, some news reported.

This needs some link of evidence.
