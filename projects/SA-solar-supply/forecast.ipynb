    "The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar energy has brought energy availability concerns. South Australia, in particular, has been heavily reliant on solar energy since the 2016's breakdown incident. This project aims to forecast energy supply from solar photovoltaic (PV) in South Australia; a crucial step toward shaping sustainable energy strategies for the region.\n",
